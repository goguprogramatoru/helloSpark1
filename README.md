Spark training project 1

What you will learn

About this project: 
Does a word count on a story
- downloads a story to a txt file

How to do a similar project from scratch: 
- Use InteliJ IDEA (with Scala plugin installed)
- New project -> Scala -> SBT
- Files: 
    - build.sbt: you can put here the library dependencies (similar to maven)
    - src/main/scala: put your scala code here
    - src/main/resources/log4j.properties: custom logger to reduce the logging output of spark to WARN,ERROR
    - src/main/scala/Main: the app logic (download + do the spark task)

That's all !
